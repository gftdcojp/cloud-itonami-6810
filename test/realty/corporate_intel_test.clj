(ns realty.corporate-intel-test
  "Proves the value `realty.corporate-intel` actually adds: a transaction
  party that is clean on every LOCAL field (no `:sanctions-hit?`, has an
  id-doc) but IS flagged in `cloud-itonami-isic-8291`'s own demo data no
  longer silently clears -- something this actor's local-only checks alone
  would have missed entirely (see `party-9` in `realty.store/demo-data`,
  shared name with 8291's sanctions-flagged demo official).

  Note: `:kyc/screen` NEVER auto-commits at any phase (only
  `:listing/intake` does, see `realty.phase`) -- every scenario below that
  reaches `:commit` does so via an explicit approve, same as every other
  `:kyc/screen` test in `governor_contract_test.clj`. Only a HARD violation
  (a local `:sanctions-hit?`, or a stubbed definitive corporate-intel
  `:hit? true`) settles immediately with no interrupt at all -- 8291's OWN
  real hits always escalate for 8291's own human review first (no
  shortcut, no peeking behind its DisclosureGovernor), so the end-to-end
  proof here is 'no longer silently clears', not 'now hard-holds' -- see
  `corporate-intel-catches-the-hit-local-checks-miss` below."
