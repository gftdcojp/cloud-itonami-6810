  "RealtorGovernor -- the independent compliance layer that earns the
  Realtor-LLM the right to commit. The LLM has no notion of jurisdiction
  disclosure law, AML/sanctions exposure or when an act stops being a
  draft and becomes a real-world title transfer / escrow disbursement, so
  this MUST be a separate system able to *reject* a proposal and fall back
  to HOLD -- the real-estate analog of `cloud-itonami-M6910`'s
  RegistrarGovernor, robotaxi's Minimal Risk Condition and
  gftd-talent-actor's PolicyGovernor.

  Five checks, in priority order. The first three are HARD violations: a
  human approver CANNOT override them (you don't get to approve your way
  past an AML/sanctions hit or a fabricated disclosure requirement). The
  last two are SOFT: they ask a human to look (low confidence / actuation),
  and the human may approve -- but see `realty.phase`: for `:stake
  :actuation` (a real title-transfer recording or escrow-fund
  disbursement) NO phase ever allows auto-commit either. Two independent
  layers agree that actuation is always a human call.

    1. Spec-basis        -- did the jurisdiction proposal cite an OFFICIAL
                             source (`realty.facts`), or invent one?
    2. Sanctions hold     -- does any party on the listing carry a
                             sanctions/PEP hit (screened or on file) --
                             real estate is a well-known AML vector?
    3. Document complete  -- for a closing proposal, are the jurisdiction's
                             required disclosure/title docs actually
                             satisfied?
    4. Confidence floor   -- LLM confidence below threshold -> escalate.
    5. Actuation gate     -- :stake :actuation -> always escalate; never
                             auto, at any phase (structural, not a policy
                             toggle)."
